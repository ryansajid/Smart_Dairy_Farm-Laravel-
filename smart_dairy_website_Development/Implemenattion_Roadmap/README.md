## QUICK START GUIDE

### For Project Manager

1. **Read Master Roadmap**: Start with `Master_Implementation_Roadmap.md` for complete overview
2. **Review Phase 1**: Read `Phase_01_Foundation_Infrastructure.md` to understand phase structure
3. **Review Milestone 1.1**: Read `Phase_1/Milestone_01_Project_Kickoff.md` to understand day-by-day execution
4. **Set Up Project Tracking**: Use Jira/Trello/GitHub Projects to track all 150 milestones
5. **Schedule Kickoff**: Schedule Phase 1, Milestone 1.1 kickoff meeting

### For Developers

1. **Understand Your Role**: Review `Developer_Allocation_Matrix.md` to see your specific responsibilities
2. **Check Phase Allocation**: Find phases where you have high allocation (e.g., D1 leads Phases 5, 6, 9)
3. **Review Daily Tasks**: Look at Milestone documents to see specific daily tasks
4. **Prepare Workstation**: Follow Day 1-3 tasks in Milestone 1.1 for environment setup

## DOCUMENT CREATION WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Create Phase Documents (14 documents)

**Time Estimate**: 1-2 hours per phase = 14-28 hours total

**For Each Phase**:
1. Copy Phase_01 template
2. Update phase details from Master Roadmap
3. Summarize 10 milestones (objectives, deliverables, allocation)
4. Add phase-specific risks, testing, budget
5. Review and publish

**Tools**: VS Code, Markdown editor

---

### Step 2: Create Milestone Documents (149 documents)

**Time Estimate**: 2-4 hours per milestone = 298-596 hours total

**For Each Milestone**:
1. Copy Milestone_01 template
2. Update milestone details
3. **Critical**: Create 10-day task breakdown:
   - Break down milestone objectives into daily tasks
   - Assign each task to D1, D2, or D3
   - Specify morning/afternoon sessions
   - Define daily deliverables
   - Include daily standups
4. Update dependencies, metrics, lessons learned
5. Review and publish

**Tools**: VS Code, Markdown editor, project knowledge

**Tip**: Start with Phase 1 milestones first (already familiar with content), then move to other phases.

---

### Step 3: Create Subdirectories (14 directories)

**Command**:
```bash
mkdir -p Phase_2 Phase_3 Phase_4 Phase_5 Phase_6 Phase_7 Phase_8 Phase_9 Phase_10 Phase_11 Phase_12 Phase_13 Phase_14 Phase_15
```

## KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. **Consistency**
- Use same structure for all Phase documents
- Use same structure for all Milestone documents
- Maintain consistent terminology

### 2. **Detail Level**
- Phase documents: High-level (10 milestones summarized in 2-3 paragraphs each)
- Milestone documents: Very detailed (10 days with morning/afternoon tasks for each developer)

### 3. **Realism**
- Base task estimates on actual work complexity
- Include buffer time (10-20%) for unexpected issues
- Reference actual technology documentation when defining tasks

### 4. **Cross-References**
- Link between Master → Phase → Milestone documents
- Reference dependencies clearly
- Link to external docs (Odoo docs, AWS docs, etc.)
