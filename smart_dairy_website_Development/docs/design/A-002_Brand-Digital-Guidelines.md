## 7. Tone of Voice

### 7.1 Voice Characteristics

Our brand voice is:

| We Are | We Are Not |
|--------|-----------|
| Authentic & Honest | Deceptive or exaggerated |

| Professional | Overly casual or sloppy |

### 7.2 Tone Guidelines

**Error Message:**

**Better:**
✅ "We use modern farming techniques to help our cows produce the best milk possible."

**Too Casual:**
❌ "Yo! Grab some of our sick organic milk. It's lit! 🔥"

**Better:**
