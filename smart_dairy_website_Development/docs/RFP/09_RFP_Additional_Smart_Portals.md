   - Initial development cost
   - First-year infrastructure cost
   - First-year licensing cost

2. **Payment Terms (25%)**
   - Milestone-based payments vs. upfront
   - Retention terms
   - Flexibility in payment schedule

3. **Value for Money (25%)**
   - Features vs. cost comparison
   - Quality indicators in proposal

**Commercial Score Formula:**
```
Commercial Score = (Lowest Bid / Vendor Bid) × 100
```

### 13.5 Final Score Calculation

```
Final Score = (Technical Score × 0.60) + (Commercial Score × 0.40)
```

The vendor with the highest final score will be recommended for contract award, subject to successful negotiation and reference verification.
