**FARM-004: What is RFID and how does it work?**

**RFID = Radio Frequency Identification**

**What It Does:**
- Uses small tags attached to animals
- Each tag has unique identification number
- Reader wirelessly reads tag without contact
- Fast and accurate animal identification

**RFID Components:**

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **RFID Tag** | Small plastic/metal tag attached to animal ear |
| **RFID Reader** | Handheld device that reads tags (provided) |
| **Mobile App** | Software that processes RFID scan |
| **Database** | Stores animal data linked to RFID tag |

**Using RFID Reader:**
1. Turn on reader (press power button)
2. Open Farm Worker App on phone/tablet
3. Hold reader near animal's RFID tag (within 5cm)
4. Reader beeps when tag detected
5. Animal information appears on phone screen
6. Use for registration, health recording, milk yield, etc.

**Benefits:**
- Instant animal identification (no searching ear tags)
- Accurate (can't misread animal)
- Fast (1 second to scan)
- No errors from misreading ear tags
- Works through mud/dirt on ear tag

**Troubleshooting:**
- **No beep:** Check reader battery, hold closer to tag, check tag not damaged
- **Wrong animal:** Scan again, verify RFID number on screen
