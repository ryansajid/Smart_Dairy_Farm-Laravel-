### 1.1 Purpose

The Sprint Retrospective is a Scrum ceremony held at the end of each sprint to:

## 7. SAFETY CHECK

### 7.1 Anonymous Safety Check

**Scale**: 1 (Not safe) to 5 (Very safe)

**Interpretation**:

| 4.5 - 5.0 | Very safe | Proceed normally |
| 3.5 - 4.4 | Mostly safe | Monitor, encourage sharing |
| 2.5 - 3.4 | Concerns | Address safety concerns first |
| 1.0 - 2.4 | Unsafe | Stop retro, address root cause |

### 7.2 Creating Psychological Safety

**Do**:
- Start with appreciations

### 8.3 Sprint Velocity Trend

Track story points completed per sprint to identify:
- Capacity trends

---

## 9. ANTI-PATTERNS

### 9.1 Common Anti-Patterns

|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Blame Game** | Finger-pointing at individuals | Focus on system, not people |
| **Complaint Session** | Only problems, no solutions | Require action items |
| **Silent Room** | No one participates | Use structured activities |
| **Solution Jumping** | Skip data gathering | Follow the phases |
| **Action Overload** | Too many action items | Limit to 2-3 items |
| **Same Actions** | Same items every sprint | Review previous actions |
| **Manager Speaking** | Manager dominates | Manager listens only |
| **Skipping Retro** | "We're too busy" | Make it non-negotiable |
