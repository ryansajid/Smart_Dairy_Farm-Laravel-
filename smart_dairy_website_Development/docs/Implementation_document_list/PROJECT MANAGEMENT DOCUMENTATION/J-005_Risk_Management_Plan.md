|--------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Change project plan to eliminate the risk or protect objectives |
| **When to Use** | High-impact risks that can be eliminated with reasonable effort |
| **Cost** | May increase project cost or time |
| **Example** | Choose proven technology instead of cutting-edge to avoid technical risk |

**Smart Dairy Application:**
- Use well-established payment gateway instead of building custom solution
- Select vendors with proven track record in Bangladesh market
- Choose cloud infrastructure with local presence to avoid latency issues

#### 5.1.2 Mitigate (Reduce Probability and/or Impact)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Take action to reduce probability of occurrence and/or impact |
| **When to Use** | Most common strategy for significant risks |
| **Cost** | Moderate investment in prevention measures |
| **Example** | Conduct thorough testing to reduce defect probability |

**Smart Dairy Application:**
- Implement code reviews and pair programming to reduce defect rates

- Establish backup vendor relationships for critical components

#### 5.1.3 Transfer (Shift Impact to Third Party)

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Definition** | Shift negative impact and ownership to third party |
| **When to Use** | When third party can manage risk better than project team |
| **Cost** | Insurance premiums, contract costs |
| **Example** | Purchase insurance, use fixed-price contracts |

| **Definition** | Acknowledge risk but take no action unless it occurs |
| **When to Use** | Low-priority risks or when other strategies not feasible |
| **Types** | Active (contingency reserve) or Passive (deal with it if happens) |
| **Example** | Minor risks with low probability and impact |

**Smart Dairy Application:**
- Accept minor UI cosmetic issues that don't affect functionality
- Monitor low-probability infrastructure risks with established vendors

### 5.2 Opportunity Response Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Exploit** | Ensure opportunity is realized | Secure early market entry by fast-tracking features |
